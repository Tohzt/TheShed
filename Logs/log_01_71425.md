# IoT to Cloud: Connecting My Shed’s ESP32 Sensor to a Next.js App with MQTT and Prisma

## What We Set Out to Do

I wanted to connect an ESP32 microcontroller (with a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor) in my shed to my cloud-based Next.js app. The goal: send real-time sensor data from the ESP32, through the cloud, and into my app’s dashboard—using scalable, modern tech.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. SSH & Server Setup

- Generated and configured SSH keys for secure, passwordless access to my DigitalOcean droplet.
- Verified access and learned how to transfer files and manage the server remotely.

### 2. MQTT Pipeline

- Set up a free HiveMQ Cloud MQTT broker for secure, scalable message passing.
- Updated the ESP32 sketch to publish sensor readings to the MQTT topic.

### 3. Node.js MQTT Subscriber

- Wrote a Node.js script using `mqtt.js` and Prisma to:
  - Subscribe to the MQTT topic.
  - Parse incoming sensor data.
  - Write readings to a MySQL database (with device auto-registration).
- Deployed the script to my server, fixed missing dependencies, and handled Prisma client generation.

### 4. Environment & Prisma Fixes

- Learned that standalone Node.js scripts need explicit `.env` loading with `dotenv`.
- Fixed a typo in the require statement and ensured the `DATABASE_URL` was available to Prisma.

### 5. End-to-End Success

- Saw live sensor data flow from the ESP32, through HiveMQ, into the Node.js subscriber, and finally into the MySQL database.
- Confirmed the data is now available for my Next.js app to display.

## What I Learned

- How to securely manage server access and environment variables.
- The importance of explicit environment loading in standalone Node.js scripts.
- How to debug Prisma and Node.js errors in a production-like environment.
- The power of MQTT for scalable, real-time IoT data flows.

## What’s Next?

- Run the subscriber as a background service (using PM2 or systemd).
- Build out dashboards and visualizations in the Next.js app.
- Add more sensors and devices to the MQTT pipeline.

**This was a huge step forward in my IoT journey—my shed is now officially cloud-connected!**
